# Random Password Generator in Java

This repository contains the implementation of a **Random Password Generator** in Java, developed as part of my internship at **TechnoHacks EduTech**. The generator creates random passwords with customizable complexity, including options for numbers, lowercase and uppercase alphabets, special characters, and complex combinations. The project incorporates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and proper **exception handling** to ensure robust functionality.

## Project Overview 📚

The Random Password Generator allows you to:
- Generate passwords that include:
  - **Numbers**
  - **Lowercase alphabets**
  - **Uppercase alphabets**
  - **Special characters**
  - **Complex combinations** (Mix of all above)
- Specify the length of the password.
- Handle invalid inputs and exceptions.

## Features 🛠️

- **Customizable Password Generation**: Choose password complexity by selecting different character sets.
- **Randomized Output**: Each password is generated randomly, ensuring security and uniqueness.
- **Exception Handling**: Prevents errors due to incorrect inputs.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Built using OOP for easy maintenance and future extensions.
